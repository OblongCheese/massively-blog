## About me

Hello, my name is Owen. This website will serve as a basic portfolio for my personal projects. I have tried and failed many times in the recent past to put up and maintain a website such as this, but I feel as though it has been due to a lack of structure in my approach to such endeavours. That in turn was due to a lack of ability to execute on any ideas, to turn into plans, to turn into actions, to turn into results.

Now that I am a little bit older, a little bit wiser, and a little bit freer-of-time, I will hopefully be able to keep this site going a little longer and generate a little more content than in previous attempts.
